This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch using only the NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy libraries. It is designed to recognize handwritten alphabets and takes 28x28 pixel images as input.

To run the project, CUDA needs to be installed on your system.

Although the project serves primarily as a proof of concept and has significant room for improvement, I welcome any contributions to enhance its capabilities.

The model achieves 90% accuracy when tested with this dataset: AZ Handwritten Alphabets in CSV Format.

Feel free to use any part of the code; it is open and free for everyone.
